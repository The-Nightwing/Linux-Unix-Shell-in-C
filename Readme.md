### System Calls Used:
    1)Fork(): Used for creating a new process, known as child process and it concurrently runs with the parent process.
    2)execvp(): the created child process does not have to run the same program as the parent process does. The execvp system call allow a 
    process to run any C file, whose executable file can be made.
    3)chdir():It changes the current directory of the calling process to the directory specified in path.
    4)readdir():This function returns a pointer to a dirent struct variable
    pointing the next directory
    5)opendir():This function opens a directory corresponding to the directory name given and returns a pointer of that directory
    6)wait(): It blocks the calling process until one of the child processes exits. After child process 
    exits or ends, parent continues its execution after wait call instruction.
    7)unlink(): unlink() deletes a file from the filesystem.
    8)remove(): used to delete a file or directory.
    9)mkdir(): creates a new directory of the name passed in it as argument.
    10)getcwd(): used to get current working directory
    11)exit(): exits out of the program.
    >>exit
